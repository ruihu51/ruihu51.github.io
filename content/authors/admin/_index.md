Hi! I am currently a final-year PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My research mainly focuses on causal inference, survival analysis and nonparametric estimation. During my PhD studies, I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ted Westling](https://tedwestling.com/). Under his guidance, I work on several projects to develop nonparametric statistical methods for observational studies in causal inference, such as nonparametric inference for heterogenous treatment effects and sensitivity analysis.
